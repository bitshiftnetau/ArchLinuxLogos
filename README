## Instructions for installation of logos with rEFInd

Simply create a folder titled 'custom_icons' in the folder where refind.conf resides and place these icons there. DO NOT RENAME!!!

Then, modify your refind.conf under the 'icons_dir' option and point to this folder. This is a relative path, simply naming the folder 
will suffice if your refind.conf is in the same directory. 

For a more detailed instruction please see the theming section of the rEFInd boot manager manual, at this address:

## .svg files

If you would like the .svg file for the icons, please don't hesitate to ask.  

Happy Coding!!!
